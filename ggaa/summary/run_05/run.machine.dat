400				! value of xq to begin with
300				! step size in GeV inv_mass distribution
run_05				! name of dir to save data for analysis use 1 or 0 below 
1				! '1' to write data in file else use '0' just to run
1.0d0				! eps value of bin used in integrand.f
1d-11				! Technical_cut on Energy used in cuts.nlo3.f
1d-11				! Technical_cut on Theta used in cuts.nlo3.f
running with CF=-1 in reduced born real.dat modified 
further data is added into the queue
This is the case for vir=0 in both cases.
NLOT.dat contains both data for vir=0 and included.
virtual.dat also is calculated here.
