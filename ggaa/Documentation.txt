=================================> [9 July] :

 PK_Plus and PK_standalone both with

	sig = SumPlus ! xx(4)*coef

Is giving same result(first digit only) for 5d+7 vegas points.
Now i am saving data in the summary run2_00 under ggaa Directory.

Using the cuts also there is no problem now in the code, Now we can use the actual Plus distribution and give it a run. Without the 


	sig = SumPlus ! xx(4)*coef

same configuration but actual Plus distribution. 

git commit ID : d2a0cc8f5237159d72cdf6e120785c01dcbcfcc5
message     Plus distribution with dummy expression with coef and xl removed




=================================> [15 July]

PK_standalone is giving double the value in PK_Plus. However in the Dummy Plus it was giving same values.
-Today I want to check the difference also, 
-I have to run the Regular as well as Delta for the completeness of the code. 
-[18:30] Regular and Delta are also runing as per the expecttion. I am still figuring out the [+] part.
-[+] expression will be sorted today only.



=================================> [16 July]

- I have constructed a new branch "Working_Plus" where [+] expression is matching with both the implementation.
- In the same branch I want to use the virtual expression from slicing 

- Reference code for the comparison of NLO correction is to be proporly calculated. [todo]
