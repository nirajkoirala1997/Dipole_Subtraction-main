=================================> [9 July] :

 PK_Plus and PK_standalone both with

	sig = SumPlus ! xx(4)*coef

Is giving same result(first digit only) for 5d+7 vegas points.
Now i am saving data in the summary run2_00 under ggaa Directory.

Using the cuts also there is no problem now in the code, Now we can use the actual Plus distribution and give it a run. Without the 


	sig = SumPlus ! xx(4)*coef

same configuration but actual Plus distribution.
