# - external_legs / propagators: 2-element sequence
#       [ [in vertex, out vertex], feynman_rule_id: [field(s)] ]
#     a field has 6 entries:
#       [particle name, field type, commutator sign, momentum, mass, field index]
#     where the field types are: 1=incoming, 2=outgoing, 3=internal
# - vertices: 1-element sequence
#       [feynman_rule_id: [fields]
#
# - comments
#   * The momenta directions of the initial state particles are
#     incoming and the momenta of the final state particles are
#     outgoing.
#   * The momenta of the fields around a vertex are all ingoing
#     to that vertex.
#   * For a propagator, the first entry in the fields list specifies
#     the particle type and the propagator momentum along the particle
#     flow.
#   * Particle flows are directed from higher to lower field indices,
#     such that fermion chains will usually be assembled from lower
#     to higher field indices.
#   * When glueing together a vertex and a propagator at a given field
#     index, the particle names in the respective first entries of the
#     field specifications coincide.
