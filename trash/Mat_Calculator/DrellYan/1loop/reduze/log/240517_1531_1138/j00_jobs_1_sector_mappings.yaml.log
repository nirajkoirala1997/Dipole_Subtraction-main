Updating job queue dependencies
Processing jobs in serial mode (non-MPI build)
Inserted new job in queue: job(1): setup sector mappings
Updating job queue dependencies
Loading uncrossed integral families from file ./config/integralfamilies.yaml
Initialize integral family 'F1'
Loaded integral family F1
Loaded 1 (uncrossed) integral families
Done loading uncrossed integral families
Created auxiliary job setup_crossings
Created auxiliary job verify_permutation_symmetries for family: F1
Inserted new job in queue: job(2): verify permutation symmetries of family 'F1'
Inserted new job in queue: job(3): setup crossings
Updated job queue:
  [p] job(3): setup crossings  [dep: ]
  [p] job(2): verify permutation symmetries of family 'F1'  [dep: 3]
  [p] job(1): setup sector mappings  [dep: 2,3]
