* WORKING WITH CODE *


1> paste the qgraf output into the folder and rename it to "amp.qgraf".

2> Same for complex conjugate of amplitude , name of the file will be ampc.qgraf .

3> In input file write the initial state and final state vector for the particle in following form.

   Incoming fermion -> U(index in qgraf, momenta, mass)
   Incoming anti-fermion -> VB(index in qgraf, momenta, mass)
   Outgoing fermion -> UB(index in qgraf, momenta, mass)
   Outgoing anti-fermion -> V(index in qgraf, momenta, mass)
    
   Incoming Boson -> e(li<qgraf index (without minus sign)>,momenta,mass)
   Outgoing Boson -> e(li<qgraf index (without minus sign)>,momenta,mass)

3a>In input file mention the number of diagrams for both amplitude and amplitudeC.

   #$dia = "# of diagrams for amplitude";
   #$diaC = "# of diagrams for amplitudeC";


4> Check all the feynman rules are there for the substitution from the qgraf file.

5> Define mandelsterm variable according to the process.

6> In mat_amp.frm give the polarization sum for the external bosons.

     id e(l11?,p1?,m?)*e(li2?,p1?,m?)="pol";

7> give spin and color avg in lines and uncomment ;

   *multiply ("spin avg");
   *multiply ("color avg");


8> If no gamma 5 is present uncomment  "#call larin(mat)"  only

9> If gamma 5 is present choose the scheme you want to work in for gamma5.
