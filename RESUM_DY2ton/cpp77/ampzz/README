to build the amplitudes (MATRIX takes care of the following automatically):

- compile and install cln from the external/ directory

- compile and install ginac from the external directory:
for this, you need to modify the first line in cln.pc

- export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="."

- adjust the PREFIX variable in the Makefile to point to your cln/ginac installation

- put a symbolic link to libZZ.a in the amp/ppzz02/ directory

- update GINAC_CLNDIR in the main MUNICH makefile to point to your cln/ginac installation
