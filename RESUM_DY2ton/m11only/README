Run information: make && ./run.x
Output file name is adjusted in input.input

 
Makefile       :: is the makefile to compile
GRinc.f        :: is the main file
FunGRinc.f     :: Mellin inversion is done here. See arXiv:0202251 appendix for more.
born.f         :: contains the born factors for processes. (currently Higgs, DY, GR)
bornaddon.f    :: contains some extra subroutines for born DY in particular
constants.h    :: All the anomalous dimensions and constants are collected here
partonLHAPDF.f :: contains subroutine to get PDF from lhapdf
vsup.f         :: is the vegas integrator. (In principle we can use Cuba. I have to check the speed test later. GD)

vegas.input    :: contains vegas input parameters
input.input    :: is the file for general inputs
in_add.input   :: is the file for ADD parameters
in_rs.input    :: is the file for RS parameters


resum_dy.h     :: contains the resum exponent, SV and Delta(resum) for DY
resum_grqqb.h  :: contains the resum exponent, SV and Delta(resum) for qqbar channel through GR production 
resum_grgg.h   :: contains the resum exponent, SV and Delta(resum) for gg channel through GR production 


Typical runtime for 1lac vegas point to get 3rd decimal accuracy ~ 5 mins in Apple Mac OSX with GNU Fortran (GCC) 6.3.0 compiler
